VIOSO Warp & Blend API

This library is meant to be used in image generators, to do warping and blending. It takes a .vwf export and a texture buffer to sample from.
If no texture buffer is given, it uses a copy of the current back buffer. It will render to the currently set back buffer.
It provides image based warping, suitable for most cases and, if a 3D map is provided, dynamc eye warping.

There are exampels provided, use Visual Studio 2010 or better.
Copy contents VIOSOWarpBlend/bin to your output directory.
